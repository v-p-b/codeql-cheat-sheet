# CodeQL Cheat Sheet

## Requirements

The site is generated with [MkDocs Material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material):

`pip install mkdocs-material`

Running the sample code and CodeQL queries need their respective development environments...

## Build

`mkdocs build`

The `site/` directory will contain the generated documentation.

## Development

`mkdocs serve` starts a local webserver and live-updates documentation content.
